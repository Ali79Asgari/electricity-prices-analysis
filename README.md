# Electricity Price Prediction for Denmark

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning framework to predict daily electricity prices in Denmark using historical data. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the project identifies patterns in electricity price data to deliver accurate forecasts. The solution is designed to support energy analysts, policymakers, and stakeholders in the energy sector with data-driven insights for decision-making.

The primary objective is to construct a robust predictive model for daily electricity prices and to provide interactive dashboards for visualizing data and prediction outcomes. Implemented in Python, the project utilizes a suite of data science libraries to ensure a reproducible and scalable workflow.
